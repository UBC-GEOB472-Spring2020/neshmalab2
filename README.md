### Reflective Analysis: 
I designed my map for those interested in the distribution of schools in the City of Birmingham. This map is also useful for individuals, most likely parents, looking for schools within their area. This map addresses possible questions of where new schools need to be built, particularly in places where there are less schools. My map is successful in quickly and easily conveying data to the user. It is also successful in demonstrating where new schools may need to be built. Therefore, the user does not take too much time to decode the map. 

This map incorporates a hover over feature, which displays the name of the school. I also implemented a white box containing text to describe the nature of the data. I used Leaflet to carry this out, with data I found from GitHub. 

I used an orange colour for the circle point, with a radius of 4. I kept the opacity of the points at 1, but also made sure to darken the weight of the circle border so that each point could be distinguished easily. My choice of orange was based on the fact that it stands out, but it not too bright. This orange colour easily fits in with the overall aesthetic of the map, and works to form a visual hierarchy, with the school data being the most important layer. I used a tilelayer which displays roads, water and land use, as well as place names and points of interest. The colours used in this basemap are presented clearly, and are not overly muted.

I initially intended to include more interactivity in this map. This interactivity would have included a search box, allowing for the user to search for the type of school they wished to see displayed on the map. However, whilst doing this, I came across some issues within my code which I could not resolve in the time I had. As a result, I kept this map fairly simple, but clean. However, I intend to continue to work on this code to further my learning, and optimise the use of this map.
